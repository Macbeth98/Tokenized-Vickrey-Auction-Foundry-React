# Tokenized Auction

This project involves developing an auction contract where each auctioned item is represented by a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), and the collateral used in the auction is an ERC20 Token, which is chosen by the seller of the NFT. To interact with this contract, a front-end user interface (UI) will be created using React. Metamask will serve as the web3 provider, facilitating blockchain interactions. Additionally, the application will be hosted on web3.storage, ensuring accessibility and integration with decentralized web technologies.

## Smart-Contracts

### Foundry was used for the development and testing of Smart Contracts.

- Check the [Foundry-Solidity](https://github.com/Macbeth98/Tokenized-Vickrey-Auction-Foundry-React/tree/master/Foundry-Solidity) Folder for more information on Smart Contracts implemenatation.

## Front-End

### The UI was developed with React and interacts with Metamask installed in the browser for its contract interactions and commnucations.

- Check the [FrontEnd](https://github.com/Macbeth98/Tokenized-Vickrey-Auction-Foundry-React/tree/master/FrontEnd) directory for more information on the interface implementation.
